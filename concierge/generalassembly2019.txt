As Hackerspace Brussels is a Belgian non-profit (VZW/ASBL), 
we need to have at least one General Assembly a year.

We will have our yearly GA on Saturday 30th of March 2019, starting 14h.
https://hsbxl.be/events/ga/14

On a general assembly we discuss and vote on important issues, like:
- Acceptance books of last year
- Acceptance financial budget plan for next year
- Acceptance of the decisions of the board for last year
- Votes on new boardmembers
- Changes of statute

As you are a member of the Hackerspace, please come over and have a voice.
To be a lawful GA, we need a presence of at least $QUORUM people.
This means it is important you come over.

If you want to read more about General assemblies and non-profits,
we collected a few interesting links on https://hsbxl.be/ga

Hope to see you there!


Cheers,
the HSBXL board.
