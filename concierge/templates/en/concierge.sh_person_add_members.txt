Welcome aboard

Hello $FIRSTNAME,

This e-mail is the confirmation that you are registered as an official
member of Hackerspace Brussels VZW/ASBL.

Since we have to spend money for the facilities, internet and electricity,
we need to ask you some every month. Not much, but it's enough to keep us 
afloat. You can ask your bank to make an automatic transfer to the following
bank account: $BANKACCOUNT
Monthly amount: $MONTHLYFEE $CURRENCY
Communication: $STRUCTUREDCOMM

The amount specified is the minimum amount agreed on during the general assembly. 
You can give more if you can afford it.

You *MUST* use the communication string above: it allow us to automate the
day by day follow up of the financial aspect of the association.

An HSBXL account and a password have been automatically generated for you for 
HSBXL services, like the trolling page (https://troll.hsbxl.be), our Matrix 
server (https://ptt.hackerspace.be), the thin client desktops and the elevator 
RFID tag manager. You can change it at the bar or at the thin client 
workstations at the electronic lab.

Keep this mail around: since we're hashing your passwords, it cannot be emailed
back to you.
