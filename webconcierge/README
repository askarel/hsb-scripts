webconcierge - a bunch of small scripts for self service management...
		... Because writing user input in bash is quite cumbersome. :-)

All modules are independent and self-contained at the moment. The only shared 
bit is a library that contain some helper functions to avoid copy/pasting similar
functions across several files. The consequence is that you will need to set 
server and credentials in multiple files. This is going to be fixed in the future
for server settings.

A working LDAP setup is MANDATORY, the HSBXL schema add-on is OPTIONAL, but
recommended if you want to use ldapviewer.php to it's full potential.

It consist of the following files:

* libaskarel.php - a library of simple helper functions
* ldapviewer.php - a simple and crude password manager
* lostcredentials.php - a simple password changer
